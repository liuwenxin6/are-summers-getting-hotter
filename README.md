# are-summers-getting-hotter
Final project for MATH 138 Mathematical probability and statistics from Spring 2021: An analysis on the temperature increase in the past four Summers at Hofstra. Summer temperatures from 2017-2020 gathered from the Hofstra University's weather station are analyzed to conclude if summers are getting hotter.

Raw data was first pre-processed and normalized using R by averaging uneven raw weather data to 5-minute interval data. Then, ANOVA test and 3 pairwise test of statistical hypotheses for two means are used to examine the relationships of the summer temperatures for 2017-2020.
