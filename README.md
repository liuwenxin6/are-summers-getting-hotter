# are-summers-getting-hotter
Final project for MATH 138 Mathematical probability and statistics from Spring 2021: An analysis on the temperature increase in the past four Summers at Hofstra. Summer temperatures from 2017-2020 gathered from the Hofstra University's weather station are analyzed to conclude if summers are getting hotter.

Raw data was first pre-processed and normalized using R by averaging uneven raw weather data to 5-minute interval data. Then, ANOVA test and 3 pairwise test of statistical hypotheses for two means are used to examine the relationships of the summer temperatures for 2017-2020. 

The reasons for using only four years of data was that the weather station local at Hofstra University only has data starting 2017. I wanted to use data that are relatively local, since similar studies using globally known data have been done in the academia already (also to avoid my professor suspecting plagerisms). I do agree that this project would be a lot cooler if I was using like 20 years or 50 years of data, but due to availabilities and other considerations, I decided to go with whatever available on hand.
